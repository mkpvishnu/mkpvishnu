# Hey, I'm Vishnu 👋

**SDET by day, RF nerd by curiosity, chaos engineer by Minecraft.**

I break things professionally (cloud infrastructure, APIs, GPU instances) and occasionally build things that work. Currently obsessed with making test pipelines smarter and exploring how AI can make QA less painful.

---

### 🔧 What I Do

- **Testing & Automation** — Python, pytest, Locust, FastAPI, Jenkins pipelines, performance testing at scale
- **Cloud & Infra** — VM orchestration, GPU compute testing, AWS, OpenSearch/Elasticsearch, PromQL/LogQL
- **AI/ML Testing** — Quality metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, F1), ML pipeline validation, agentic framework testing
- **RF/ML Research** — Digital Predistortion for power amplifiers, 5G/6G signal processing, published papers

### 🏗️ Things I've Built & Broken

**AI Testing Framework**
- Architected a comprehensive AI testing framework with FastAPI
- Built quality metrics system (BLEU, ROUGE, recall, F1) for model evaluation
- Fine-tuned in-house models for sentiment analysis and language detection
- Designed modular architecture — 5 minute integration into any product

**Enterprise AI Platform Testing**
- Tested AI backbone platforms handling millions of customer interactions
- Coordinated cross-team integration testing across 7+ product teams and 20+ engineers
- If it touched AI at enterprise scale, I probably broke it first

**Agentic Framework Services**
- End-to-end testing for next-gen agentic frameworks
- Built mock servers to simulate real customer interactions
- Load tested to find optimal concurrency parameters (the hard way)

**MLOps & Search Systems**
- Tested ML pipelines end-to-end, significantly reduced production incidents
- Deployed and maintained OpenSearch clusters in AWS
- Validated document ingestion processes handling millions of records

### 🚀 Current Obsessions

- Building **Pynch** — an AI-native API testing tool with MCP server generation
- Smarter CI/CD with better observability and Slack notifications that don't suck
- Figuring out how to give AI coding assistants enough context without hitting token limits

### 🎮 When I'm Not Coding

- Running Minecraft servers with overcomplicated command block contraptions
- Designing parkour courses and arena combat systems nobody asked for
- Traveling for pilgrimages and adding stamps to the passport
